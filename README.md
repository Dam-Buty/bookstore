# INCREDIBLE BookStore

*Purveyors of fine litterature to the Royal Crown of England since 1745*

## Dependencies :

Software :
* **NodeJS**
* **Gulp**

Libraries
* **AngularJS** : because i'm familiar with it, and it is profusely documented
* **PureCSS** : because it is microscopic, while packing a nifty responsive grid system
* **angular-utils-pagination**
* **moment.js**

## Deploy and run

Everything is in the package.json file. Just run ````sudo npm install```` from the root of the project and the required dependencies should install automatically.

The repository doesn't include a build of the application, so it is necessary to run ````gulp```` once.

If needed, a basic **connect** http server is provided. Just run ````npm start```` and point your browser to : http://127.0.0.1:8080/www .
